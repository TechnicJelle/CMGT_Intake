The game I have made for the intake for the study [Creative Media and Game Technologies](https://www.saxion.edu/programmes/bachelor/creative-media-and-game-technologies) at [Saxion University of Applied Sciences](https://www.saxion.edu/)

All assets have been made by me.\
Every line of code was written by me.

Special thanks to OneLoneCoder for his Rectangle Collisions video, which I adapted to Processing (https://github.com/TechnicJelle/Processing_OLC_Rectangles) and used for the collisions in this game.
